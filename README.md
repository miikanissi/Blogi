# Blog system for my website :pencil2: :orange_book:
This is how I create blog posts on my [personal website.](https://miikanissi.com)

I wanted my personal website to be a minimal static website which serves content using nginx. The main purpose of my website is to have a blog so I made this bash script to make the process of creating new posts very simple. This script is a modified fork from https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb.

## Features of `blogi`

`Blogi` is a small bash script that let's you write blog posts on a website. The main features are:

- Index page for all of your blog posts. [Example on my website.](https://miikanissi.com/blogindex)
- Each blog post has their own standalone page.
- Each blog post is added in it's entirety to a RSS feed. See [my RSS feed for an example.](https://miikanissi.com/rss.xml)
- Script also creates a sitemap.xml file for SEO and updates it with each post.
- Command which can delete a post from all of these pages automatically.
- Each post can also be revised after publishing.
